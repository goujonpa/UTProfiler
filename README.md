UTProfiler
==========

UTProfiler is a C++ project which was developped in the context of an object oriented course of the UTC (University of Technologie of Compi√®gne, France).

The aim of that application was to help students choosing the courses they will attend to complete their cursus.
As this project was a learning tool, it isn't really optimized, lots of changes should have been done (we've improved a lot between the beginning and the end of our project, and realized that our architecture isn't really good).

Developped by Alexandre CORTYL & Paul GOUJON
